1 - Test function/methods should only contain the necessary code to test
the specific requirement of functionality that wants to be tested, any database
set up, network connections... Should be set outside the function or test.

2 - The order in which the test are run should not matter.

3 - If you make modifications to your code and tests that are in theory not
related to those modifications that you made start breaking, that is sign that
there are code smells on your code, DO NOT modify the tests so they pass (that is cheating),
go back and modify the code so all the tests pass.

4 - Any components that are outside of your scope but are necessary for tests like
databases, external APIs, socket connections... They need to be mocked so unit tests
do not depend on those components. This is only related to Unit testing, Integration
testing or end to end testing is different story.
