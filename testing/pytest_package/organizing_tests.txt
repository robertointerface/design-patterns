-where should I write the tests?
tests are normally under a python package called 'tests' like in our little
online_shopping project.


- where should I write test fixtures or hooks?
It depends, fixtures and hooks that are used by multiple tests should go under
the file conftest.py which is sort of a local plugin for our tests, note
that there can only be on conftest.py under one 'tests' package.
If fixtures are only used on a specific testing file then they can just be under
that testing file.


- How can I run the tests?
if you are doing it with the command line, use the command 'pytest'. and
follow the examples below:
single method (inside class):   pytest path/to_test_module.py::TestClass::test_method
single function test:   pytest path/to_test_module.py::test_function
all test in a class:     pytest path/to_test_module.py::TestClass
all tests in a module:  pytest path/to_test_module.py
all test in a directory: pytest path_to_directory
test matching a name patter: pytest -k pattern (you can build very complex patterns with logic terms as 'and' 'or' 'not')
